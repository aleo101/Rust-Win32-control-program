# Rust-Win32-control-program
Windows API (Win32) program written in Rust to get practice with Rust and Windows programming.

I believe this project can help you get started on making your own Windows API application in Rust!

## What is it?
This Windows GUI application is written in Rust using the new officially supported``windows`` crate [(link to crate)](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs).

## How does it work?
The program works by making calls directly to Windows API user interface functions. 

## Currently includes:
  - Buttons.
  - Edit fields (editable text-boxes).
  - A scroll-bar (slider control bar).
